# GraphQL on Rails

Some silly slides about getting started with GraphQL on Ruby on Rails.

## Reference

Created using Spectacle. The core API is available at [HERE](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle/blob/master/README.markdown).

## Running

Clone the repo and run `yarn`. (or `npm install` if you're about that life)

Then, to start up the local server, run `npm start`

Open a browser and hit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and we are ready to roll
